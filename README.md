## Correlation between BTC market movement based on twitter feeds related to bitcoin

**by Tauseef Bashir**

#### Executive summary
With the growth of market capitalization of cryptocurrencies (increased from $17 billion in 2017 to $2.25 trillion in 2021), cryptocurrencies remain incredibly volatile, with their value impacted by a multitude of factors: market trends, politics, technologyâ€¦and Twitter. There have been instances where their prices were affected by tweets by famous personalities and the general public.

I plan to analyze trends over time, particularly the impact of social media on the price volatility of a crypto asset, such as Bitcoin (BTC).
